# Protogen Controller

A work-in-progress **Protogen controller** for controlling visors, LEDs, and more. Currently, this repo mainly includes `visor.py`, but the goal is a fully-featured control suite.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** This is experimental and mostly for fun/hobbyist use.

## Features (so far)

* Control mouth, eyes, and nose LEDs via emotion masks
* Dev mode support so you can test without a Raspberry Pi

## Planned Contributions / TODO

* Add actual emotion masks (make your Protogen expressive af)
* Add advanced animations for the visor (possibly idfk, lol)
* Make a README that actually explains stuff
* Add NFC communication
* Live video using camera + small drone goggles (HUD would be sick)

If you want to help, **submit a pull request** or **open an issue**!
